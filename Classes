- statisticians are into inference, for hypothesis testing
- mean and distribution is not sufficient for them
- IS IT SIGNIFICANT? 

Dummy regression: 
X = [M, F] X' = transposed X
multiplying gives 2x2 matrix
  [ 1\avg_M       0   ]
  [ 0         1\avg_F ]
inverting ^-1 => change diagonal 

several ways to obtain results, specifications is same, but interpretation changes
=> reparametrization
a without hat is conditional expectation of wage given gender is female = constant
-> average for females

With dummys M = 1 - F, multiplying 1-F out then second constant appears that gets added to previous intercept 
then constant = average for males

further reparametrization by substituting constant with F+M (rhs of note sheet of teacher)
reg wage female male, nocons
no reference category needed, means already displayed

reference category = baseline 

dummies and constant => dummy variable trap and thus one dummy get dropped
no perfect linear collinearity
is not violated since:
M, F and 1 has a linear relationship and 1 is dropped thus works
OR
full rank condition holds: my scalars in the matrix are not multiples of each other -> linearly independent

M, F and 1 are 3 ranks
but one will be dropped of these three, only two left
3 possibilities 
1) constant + male coeff
2) constant + female coeff
3) male coef + female coeff

r^2 = ESS\TSS = 1 - RSS\TSS = [SUM ( y^hat - avg_y)^2] / SUM (y - avg_y)^2]
proportion explained by my regressors 
- regressand y^hat obtained from regression

iv. this student is violating the rank condition

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hypothesis testing - do it for the inference 
distribution of y is determining what happens in regressions
if y are normal beta^hat normality can come

never make hats on ttesting -> doesnt make sense 
average probability to jump around -> st dev
- y is normal, beta is normal thus ~N(0,1)
- combination of linear combinations results in a normal distri


STATA reg: std error is hatted standard error based on beta^hat

P>|t| 
!= significance level
!= probability that the H0 is true
= probability that coefficient 
p value probabilitz under assumption and null that i obtain a test statistic \\
more unfavorable to the null than i actually obtained
=> smallest level of significance at which zou can reject the null
t is telling where we ended on xaxis of the distribution
